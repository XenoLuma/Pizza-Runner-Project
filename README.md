# Pizza-Runner-Project
A small project done in MySQL

I have created a schema to replicate data from pizza delivery shop.
Data consists of three tables; runner table, customer orders table,
and runner orders table. The customer orders table and runner orders table
shares the order id column and the runner orders table and runner table shares
the runner id column.

Created to showcase my skills in MySQL including; creating tables,
collecting data, cleaning data, and analyzing data.
