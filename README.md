# Pizza-Runner-Project
A small project done in MySQL

I have created a schema to replicate data from pizza delivery shop.
Data consists of seven tables; customer_orders, pizza_names,
pizza_recipes, pizza_toppings, runner_orders, runner_rating,
runners.

Created to showcase my skills in MySQL including; creating tables,
collecting data, cleaning data, and analyzing data.
